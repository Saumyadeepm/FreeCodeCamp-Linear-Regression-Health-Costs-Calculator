1. **Problem Statement: Health Insurance Cost Prediction**

1. **Overview**
  - *The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts health insurance costs based on various factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The model aims to accurately estimate insurance expenses to assist insurance companies in pricing policies and individuals in understanding potential healthcare costs.*

1. **Dataset**
  - *The dataset used for this project contains information about individuals' attributes such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and their corresponding health insurance costs. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model's performance.*

1. **Objective**
  - *The goal is to build a regression model that can predict health insurance costs based on the provided attributes with minimal error. The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) on the test dataset.*

1. **Approach**
  - **Data Preprocessing:** *Convert categorical variables into numerical representations and normalize the dataset.*
  - **Model Building:** *Construct a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras with appropriate input and output layers for regression.*
  - **Model Training:** *Train the model using the training dataset and evaluate its performance using validation data.*
  - **Model Evaluation:** *Evaluate the trained model's performance on the test dataset using metrics like MAE and MSE.*
  - **Visualization:** *Visualize the model's predictions against the true values using scatter plots to assess its accuracy and reliability.*

1. **Success Criteria**
  - *The project will be considered successful if the developed model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of less than 3500 on the test dataset. Additionally, the model's predictions should align closely with the true values as demonstrated by visualizations.*

1. **Deliverables**
  - *Trained machine learning model for health insurance cost prediction.*
  - *Evaluation report containing model performance metrics (MAE, MSE) on the test dataset.*
  - *Visualization of model predictions compared to true values for insights into performance.*
  - *Codebase including data preprocessing, model construction, training, evaluation, and visualization scripts.*
